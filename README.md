# BMI-Calculator
A simple BMI calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator allows users to input their height and weight, and it calculates their BMI and displays the corresponding category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese). It also provides a visual representation of the BMI on a bar graph.
